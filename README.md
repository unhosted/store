To add your app to the store, or edit the details of an app, you have two options:

* [edit the list on github](https://github.com/unhosted/store/blob/master/apps.js); the 'edit' button will only be enabled if you're logged in). This will allow you to create a Pull Request on github, and once we merge and deploy this, your change will be live.
* Tell me (irc/twitter: michielbdejong, email: michiel at unhosted dot org) or someone else (irc/twitter: #unhosted) about the change you propose.
